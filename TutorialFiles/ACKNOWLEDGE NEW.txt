Hello Mohammad
   Can You OPEN & READ THIS FILE ??????????????????????

hi my best friend
 yesssss i recieve this file

<<<< THANKS. JUST RECEIVED YOUR ACKNOWLEDGMENT >>>>

!!! NOW THE PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU ADD A FILE TO THE PROJECT 
( AND COMMIT AND PUSH IT TO THE SERVER ), BUT ACCIDENTALLY DELETE IT FROM 
YOUR OWN PROJECT ( LOCAL ), YOU CAN'T RETRIEVE THE FILE :((( 
YOU HAVE TO DELETE YOUR WHOLE LOCAL PROJECT FOLDER AND CLONE WHOLE PROJECT OVER AGAIN
-------------------
thank you.....:)))
------------------
no it is not neccessary to delete whole project.you shall pull it and your project will upadate in local
